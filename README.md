# pbc-liver-cirrhosis-dataset
A dataset and analysis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis patients from Mayo Clinic
## Context

This dataset focuses on a Mayo Clinic study on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver, conducted between 1974 and 1984. PBC is a progressive disease that can lead to cirrhosis, a late stage of liver scarring caused by chronic liver conditions, including hepatitis and long-term alcoholism.

The study collected data from 424 PBC patients who met the eligibility criteria for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the drug D-penicillamine. Of these patients:

- **312 cases** participated in the randomized trial and have largely complete data.
- **112 additional cases** did not participate in the trial but agreed to baseline measurements and survival follow-up. Six of these cases were lost to follow-up soon after diagnosis, leaving 106 additional cases in the dataset.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for studying clinical outcomes and survival analysis in PBC. For more background on the clinical trial and recorded covariates, refer to *Counting Processes and Survival Analysis* by Fleming and Harrington, Wiley, 1991, Chapter 0, Section 0.2, and related articles in *Hepatology* (Dickson et al., 1989) and *New England Journal of Medicine* (Markus et al., 1989).
